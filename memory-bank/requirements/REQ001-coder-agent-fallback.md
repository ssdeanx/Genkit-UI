# [REQ001] - Coder Agent Fallback Completion

Status: Proposed
Added: 2025-09-29
Updated: 2025-09-29
Priority: Critical
Type: Functional
Completion Percentage: 10%

## User Story
As an orchestrator, I want the coder agent to complete with a minimal artifact when generation fails so that workflows can proceed without hard failures.

## Requirement Statement
IF upstream code generation fails THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL emit at least one code artifact and publish a final completed status with an explanatory message.

## Acceptance Criteria
Crit-001
1. When model generation throws an error, the agent publishes an artifact-update event with a non-empty code file
2. The agent then publishes a status-update with state "completed" and final=true
3. The error is logged for observability without crashing the process

## Business Value
Ensures resilience in multi-agent flows, preventing cascaded failures and improving user experience during outages.

## Technical Constraints
- Must comply with @a2a-js/sdk event shapes (TaskArtifactUpdateEvent, TaskStatusUpdateEvent)
- Must work with Genkit ^1.20.0

## Dependencies
- DESIGN001 A2A Agent Testing Architecture

## Validation Approach
- Unit tests simulate generation failure and assert artifact + completed status are published

## Progress Tracking
