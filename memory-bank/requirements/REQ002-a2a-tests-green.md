## User Story
As a maintainer, I want all agent unit tests to pass consistently in CI so that regressions are caught early and confidence remains high.

## Requirement Statement
THE SYSTEM SHALL execute all agent executor unit tests deterministically with mocks and pass with zero failures on each CI run.

## Acceptance Criteria
Crit-001
1. All tests in src/agents/*/__tests__/*.spec.ts pass in CI
2. No network calls are made during tests
3. Genkit and SerpAPI dependencies are mocked

## Business Value
Stable CI builds, faster feedback loops, and reliable development velocity.

## Technical Constraints
- Use Vitest and projectâ€™s ESLint/TS configs
- Ensure Node types ^24.5.2 compatibility

## Dependencies
- DESIGN001 A2A Agent Testing Architecture

## Validation Approach
- Run CI job executing vitest; ensure exit code 0 and coverage thresholds (if applied)

## Progress Tracking
