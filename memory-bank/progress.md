# Progress â€” Genkit-UI

What works

Recent updates

- 2025-09-30: **ðŸŽ‰ Historic Achievement: First Perfect 100% Coverage File!** - query-analyzer.ts achieved 100% lines, 100% branches, 100% functions - first file in project history to reach perfect coverage on all metrics!
- 2025-09-30: **Planning Agent Coverage Breakthrough** - Overall: 79.87%â†’91.47% lines (+11.6%), 80.54%â†’92.16% branches (+11.62%). Added 81 new tests (16â†’97, +506.25%). Five files improved significantly: query-analyzer (100% all metrics), methodology-selector (96.99% lines), risk-assessor (95.14% lines), contingency-planner (92.03% lines), data-source-identifier (84.5% lines).
- 2025-09-30: **Systematic Testing Excellence** - Fixed 13 TypeScript errors, achieved 97/97 tests passing (100% success rate). Four files above 95% lines, five files above 90% lines, six files with 100% function coverage.
- 2025-09-30: **Critical Workflow Established** - **ALWAYS check TypeScript errors with get_errors BEFORE running tests** to prevent wasted runs. Weakest-first strategy yields 20-30% gains. Multi-round approach: Round 1 (+15-20%), Round 2 (+5-10%), Round 3 (+2-5%). Add 10-15 comprehensive tests per file for maximum impact.
- 2025-09-30: **TypeScript Patterns Documented** - Use Record<string, string | undefined> instead of 'as any'. Add explicit ': string' type annotations for lambda parameters. Verify interface definitions for exact property names (recommendations vs suggestions). Validate union types (ResearchDimension only supports 4 types). Match actual implementation behavior in test assertions.
- 2025-09-30: **ðŸŽ‰ Orchestrator Test Coverage Breakthrough!** - quality-validator.ts: 63 tests, 99.59% lines, 88.81% branches (+22.98% from 65.83%). streaming-handler.ts: 63 tests, 98.14% lines, 88.46% branches (+22.99% from 65.47%). Overall orchestrator coverage: **82.52% branches, 330 tests passing!***Full Test Suite**: All 268/268 tests passing with comprehensive coverage
- **Orchestrator Agent Tests**: All 246/246 tests now passing after resolving TypeScript lint errors and test failures
- **Code-Format Test Coverage**: Improved from 12.29% to 100% across all metrics (statements, branches, functions, lines)
- **Coder & Content-Editor Agents**: Tests for both agents are now passing. The `coder` agent includes a new resilient fallback mechanism. The `content-editor` agent now correctly implements DotPrompt loading.
- **Dual Backend Architecture**: Genkit flows (HTTP/FlowServer + Firebase Functions) and A2A agents (8 specialized agents) both functional
- **Genkit UI**: Starts and displays flows from [src/index.ts](../src/index.ts)
- **Flow Server**: HTTP server exposing flows on port 3400 with CORS
- **Firebase Functions**: Separate Genkit setup with Firebase telemetry for serverless deployment
- **A2A Agents**: 8 agents (orchestrator, planning, coder, content-editor, data-analysis, news-research, academic-research, web-research) with Express servers
- **Toolbox Integration**: Local PostgreSQL-based toolbox running with 7 tools via Docker Compose
- **CLI Client**: A2A client for agent interaction with streaming support
- **Agent Cards**: All agents have comprehensive cards with protocol 0.3.0, security schemes, and skills
- **Task Lifecycle**: Basic task management with status updates and artifacts implemented
- **State Persistence**: Metadata-based storage methods in orchestrator executor

What's left

- **A2A Streaming**: Implement ExecutionEventBus with SSE for real-time updates across all agents
- **Error Handling**: Add comprehensive A2AError codes and structured responses
- **Security**: Implement authentication middleware (API key, OAuth2, JWT) for agents
- **Client Enhancement**: Full A2AClient API usage with cancelTask, resubscribeTask
- **CI Pipeline**: Link validation, linting, and testing gates
- **Tool Hardening**: Rate limits, retries, and fallbacks for external APIs
- **Integration Testing**: Full agent orchestration flows with toolbox integration

Known issues / risks

- **External Dependencies**: Toolbox and external APIs may be unreliable in production
- **A2A Protocol Maturity**: @a2a-js/sdk in beta - potential breaking changes
- **Deployment Complexity**: Coordinating Firebase App Hosting + Functions with A2A agents
- **State Recovery**: Orchestrator state persistence needs full integration testing
