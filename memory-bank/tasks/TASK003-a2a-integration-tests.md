# TASK003 - A2A integration tests

Status: Pending
Added: 2025-09-27
Updated: 2025-09-27

## Original Request
Design and implement integration tests for A2A agent messaging and task lifecycles.

## Thought Process
Simulate messages via a mock gateway/client; assert AgentCard presence and task status transitions. Stub network and use in-memory event bus.

## Implementation Plan
 
- Define minimal agent harness for tests
- Mock A2A client to simulate send/receive
- Verify status updates (pending → running → completed/failed)
