# TASK003 - A2A integration tests

Status: Completed
Added: 2025-09-27
Updated: 2025-09-28

## Original Request
Design and implement integration tests for A2A agent messaging and task lifecycles.

## Thought Process
Simulate messages via a mock gateway/client; assert AgentCard presence and task status transitions. Stub network and use in-memory event bus.

## Implementation Plan
 
- Define minimal agent harness for tests
- Mock A2A client to simulate send/receive
- Verify status updates (pending → running → completed/failed)

## Progress Tracking

Overall Status: Completed - 100%

### Subtasks
 
| ID | Description | Status | Updated | Notes |
|----|-------------|--------|---------|-------|
| 3.1 | Draft test harness design | Complete | 2025-09-28 | Documented fallback streaming path test |
| 3.2 | Implement mocks/stubs | Complete | 2025-09-28 | DI-based clientFactory enables deterministic mocking |
| 3.3 | Add assertions for status transitions | Complete | 2025-09-28 | Verified pending → running → completed and cancel semantics |

## Progress Log
### 2025-09-27

- Created task and outlined approach

### 2025-09-28

- Refactored orchestrator A2ACommunicationManager to support DI (clientFactory/useA2AClient/useStreaming)
- Rewrote orchestrator tests to inject mock A2A client; covered streaming and cancel propagation
- All orchestrator tests green; added comprehensive planning-agent unit tests (query-analyzer, methodology-selector, data-source-identifier, step-decomposer, risk-assessor, contingency-planner)
- Full suite passing: 26 files, 100 tests; strong coverage across modules
