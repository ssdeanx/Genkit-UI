# TASK001 - Setup Memory Bank

Status: Completed
Added: 2025-09-27
Updated: 2025-09-27

## Original Request
Set up the Memory Bank structure and initial docs so we can start using it now.

## Thought Process
We followed the Memory Bank instructions and Spec‑Driven workflow to scaffold core files, link to instructions, and create an initial tasks index with example entries.

## Implementation Plan

- Create `memory-bank/` with core docs (brief, contexts, patterns, tech, progress)
- Add Spec‑Driven docs (`requirements.md`, `design.md`, `tasks.md`)
- Create `tasks/` folder with `_index.md` and this task file

## Progress Tracking
