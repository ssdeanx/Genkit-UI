# TASK007 - Final Executor Fix

Status: In Progress
Added: 2025-09-28
Updated: 2025-09-28
Notes: User is actively fixing the final executor logic in `src/agents/coder/executor.ts`.

## Original Request
“no your finish. update memory-bank while i fix this final executer … i got them all fix buit this u keep leaving filess broken #file:memory-bank”

## Thought Process

- Track the ongoing user-led change explicitly so context isn’t lost after resets.
- Keep other suites stable and avoid parallel breaking edits while this is in motion.


## Plan

- Validate coder executor after user changes land.
- Run full test suite; ensure no regressions in streaming/cancel/validation.
- Update Memory Bank to mark this task completed once verified.


## Progress Log

### 2025-09-28

- Marked task as In Progress; awaiting executor changes by user.
