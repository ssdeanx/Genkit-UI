# TASK008 - Complete A2A Protocol Implementation

Status: In Progress
Added: 2025-09-28
Updated: 2025-09-28
Notes: Comprehensive A2A SDK documentation retrieved; implementing complete protocol features across all agents.

## Original Request
Implement complete A2A protocol features using the comprehensive JavaScript SDK and TypeScript guide documentation that was retrieved.

## Thought Process

Based on the complete A2A documentation, we need to implement:

- Full Agent Card specifications with capabilities, skills, and security
- Complete task lifecycle management with all states and transitions
- Streaming support with SSE and ExecutionEventBus
- Proper error handling with A2A-specific error codes
- Server architecture using A2AExpressApp pattern
- Security implementation with multiple auth schemes
- Enhanced client communication patterns

This represents a comprehensive upgrade to bring all agents to full A2A protocol compliance.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Agent Cards Enhancement**: Update all agent cards with complete capabilities, skills, security schemes
2. **Task Lifecycle**: Implement full task state management with proper status updates and artifacts
3. **Streaming Support**: Add SSE streaming with ExecutionEventBus across all agents
4. **Error Handling**: Implement A2AError codes and structured error responses
5. **Server Architecture**: Migrate to A2AExpressApp pattern with proper middleware
6. **Security**: Add authentication schemes and security middleware
7. **Client Enhancement**: Update client usage to leverage full A2AClient API

## Progress Tracking

Overall Status: In Progress â€” Agent Cards enhanced, task lifecycle partially implemented, logging and validation fixes completed

## Progress Log
### 2025-09-28

- Enhanced Agent Cards for all 8 agents (coder, orchestrator, news-research, web-research, academic-research, planning, content-editor, data-analysis)
- Updated protocol versions to 0.3.0 for consistency
- Added comprehensive security schemes with API key authentication
- Enhanced skills with multiple specialized capabilities per agent
- Improved input/output modes to use proper MIME types (text/plain)
- Added more detailed examples and tags for better agent discovery
- Implemented task history management improvements in coder executor with metadata tracking and duplicate prevention
- Added artifact aggregation from completed delegated tasks in orchestrator executor
- Implemented state persistence methods (persistOrchestrationState/loadOrchestrationState) in orchestrator executor using metadata-based storage
