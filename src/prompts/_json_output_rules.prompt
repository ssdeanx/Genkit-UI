Only output valid JSON matching the declared output schema.
Rules:
- Do not include any text outside the JSON object/array.
- Do not include code fences.
- Do not include comments.
- Ensure field names and types exactly match the schema.
- If optional fields are omitted, do not include them with null; omit them entirely.
- Provide deterministic `id` fields for list elements when possible.
- If validation fails, return `{ "error": "<short message>" }` only (no additional text).
