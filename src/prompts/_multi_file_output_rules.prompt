Output only fenced code blocks for files with no extra commentary.
Rules:
- For each file, output exactly one fenced code block: ```<lang> <path/to/file>
- Include a brief header comment at the top describing the file purpose.
- Separate multiple files by a single blank line.
- Never output text outside code blocks.
- Do not emit diffs; always output full file contents.
- Do not invent dependency versions; adhere to repository constraints.
