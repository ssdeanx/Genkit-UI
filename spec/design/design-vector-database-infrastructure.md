## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Vector Similarity Search

**User Story:** As a `Developer`, I want to perform vector similarity searches using COSINE distance measure so that I can retrieve relevant documents based on semantic similarity to a text query.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a text query is provided to the vector search function THEN the system SHALL generate an embedding for the query using the Gemini embedding model.
2. WHEN the query embedding is generated THEN the system SHALL perform a KNN search in Firestore using COSINE distance measure.
3. WHEN search results are retrieved THEN the system SHALL return documents ordered by similarity score in descending order.
4. WHEN a configurable limit parameter is specified THEN the system SHALL restrict results to that maximum number.
5. WHEN no limit is specified THEN the system SHALL default to returning 10 results.
6. WHEN the search completes successfully THEN the system SHALL include similarity scores in the response.
7. WHEN metadata filters are combined with vector search THEN the system SHALL apply filters before performing the vector search.
8. WHEN no matching documents are found THEN the system SHALL return an empty array with totalFound set to 0.

### Requirement 2: Document Indexing and Management

**User Story:** As a `Backend Engineer`, I want to index documents with automatic embedding generation so that new content can be made searchable in the vector database.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a batch of documents is submitted for indexing THEN the system SHALL generate embeddings for each document's content using the Gemini embedding model.
2. WHEN embeddings are successfully generated THEN the system SHALL store documents in Firestore with vector fields using FieldValue.vector().
3. WHEN a document is indexed THEN the system SHALL include metadata fields for source, category, and timestamps.
4. WHEN real-time indexing is triggered THEN the system SHALL automatically generate and store embeddings for new documents.
5. WHEN batch indexing completes THEN the system SHALL return counts of successfully indexed and failed documents.
6. WHEN embedding generation fails for a document THEN the system SHALL skip that document and continue with the batch.
7. WHEN all documents in a batch fail THEN the system SHALL return an error indicating the batch indexing failure.
8. WHEN indexing operations complete THEN the system SHALL update the document's updatedAt timestamp.

### Requirement 3: Metadata Filtering and Querying

**User Story:** As a `Developer`, I want to filter vector search results using metadata so that I can narrow down results to specific categories or sources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN metadata filters are provided with a vector search THEN the system SHALL apply WHERE clauses to the Firestore query.
2. WHEN multiple metadata filters are specified THEN the system SHALL combine them using AND logic.
3. WHEN a category filter is applied THEN the system SHALL only return documents matching that category.
4. WHEN a source filter is applied THEN the system SHALL only return documents from that source.
5. WHEN date range filters are provided THEN the system SHALL filter documents by createdAt or updatedAt timestamps.
6. WHEN filtered search is performed THEN the system SHALL maintain vector similarity ordering within filtered results.
7. WHEN no documents match the metadata filters THEN the system SHALL return an empty result set.
8. WHEN invalid filter values are provided THEN the system SHALL return a validation error.

### Requirement 4: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a `Site Reliability Engineer (SRE)`, I want optimized vector database operations so that searches and indexing meet performance requirements under load.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a vector search is performed on datasets up to 100,000 documents THEN the system SHALL complete within 2 seconds.
2. WHEN batch document indexing is performed THEN the system SHALL complete within 5 seconds per document batch.
3. WHEN multiple concurrent read operations are performed THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent performance.
4. WHEN large dataset operations are performed THEN the system SHALL keep memory usage bounded.
5. WHEN pagination is requested THEN the system SHALL efficiently return results without loading all documents into memory.
6. WHEN vector index operations are performed THEN the system SHALL optimize for the fixed 768-dimension embeddings.
7. WHEN performance degrades beyond thresholds THEN the system SHALL trigger monitoring alerts.
8. WHEN concurrent users access the system THEN the system SHALL maintain data consistency.

### Requirement 5: Security and Access Control

**User Story:** As a `Security Engineer`, I want secure vector database access so that document data is protected according to user permissions and Firebase security rules.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN vector database operations are performed THEN the system SHALL require Firebase Authentication.
2. WHEN API keys are needed THEN the system SHALL retrieve them from Firebase Functions secrets.
3. WHEN document access is requested THEN the system SHALL respect Firestore security rules.
4. WHEN user permissions are checked THEN the system SHALL enforce data ownership restrictions.
5. WHEN audit logging is enabled THEN the system SHALL log all vector database operations.
6. WHEN unauthorized access is attempted THEN the system SHALL return appropriate permission denied errors.
7. WHEN sensitive data is stored THEN the system SHALL encrypt embeddings and metadata as required.
8. WHEN security violations occur THEN the system SHALL trigger security alerts.

### Requirement 6: Operational Monitoring and Management

**User Story:** As a `Site Reliability Engineer (SRE)`, I want comprehensive monitoring and management capabilities so that I can maintain the vector database infrastructure effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN vector search operations are performed THEN the system SHALL collect performance metrics.
2. WHEN performance issues are detected THEN the system SHALL trigger alerting notifications.
3. WHEN Firestore usage is monitored THEN the system SHALL track costs within Blaze plan limits.
4. WHEN vector indexes need management THEN the system SHALL handle automatic index creation and maintenance.
5. WHEN backup operations are initiated THEN the system SHALL create recoverable snapshots of vector data.
6. WHEN recovery is needed THEN the system SHALL restore vector data from backups.
7. WHEN operational dashboards are accessed THEN the system SHALL display key metrics and health indicators.
8. WHEN cost thresholds are approached THEN the system SHALL send budget alerts.

### Requirement 7: Error Handling and Reliability

**User Story:** As a `Backend Engineer`, I want robust error handling in vector operations so that the system gracefully handles failures and maintains reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN vector index creation fails THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff.
2. WHEN embedding generation fails THEN the system SHALL log errors and skip affected documents.
3. WHEN Firestore operations timeout THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic with configurable limits.
4. WHEN invalid input is provided THEN the system SHALL return descriptive error messages.
5. WHEN network connectivity issues occur THEN the system SHALL handle reconnections gracefully.
6. WHEN partial batch failures happen THEN the system SHALL continue processing remaining items.
7. WHEN critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging.
8. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific guidance on required corrections.

### Requirement 8: Integration and Compatibility

**User Story:** As a `Developer`, I want seamless integration with Genkit and Firebase so that vector database functionality works within the existing AI orchestration framework.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN vector operations are implemented THEN the system SHALL use the @genkit-ai/firebase plugin exclusively.
2. WHEN retrievers are defined THEN the system SHALL use defineFirestoreRetriever() pattern.
3. WHEN embeddings are stored THEN the system SHALL use FieldValue.vector() for Firestore compatibility.
4. WHEN flows integrate vector search THEN the system SHALL use Google AI embedders in Genkit flows.
5. WHEN input validation is needed THEN the system SHALL use Zod schemas for all vector operations.
6. WHEN vector dimensions are specified THEN the system SHALL enforce the fixed 768-dimension requirement.
7. WHEN Firebase Blaze plan limits are approached THEN the system SHALL prevent operations that would exceed limits.
8. WHEN Genkit flows are executed THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility with existing AI orchestration patterns.
