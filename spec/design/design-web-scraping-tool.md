7. WHEN the URL is invalid THEN the system **SHALL** throw a descriptive error without attempting to fetch.
8. WHEN the request times out THEN the system **SHALL** retry up to the configured limit before failing.
9. WHEN the page returns a non-200 status code THEN the system **SHALL** handle the error appropriately based on the status.

### Requirement 2: Multi-page Site Crawling

**User Story:** As a `Content Analyst`, I want to crawl multiple pages from a website so that I can gather comprehensive site data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a base URL and crawl options are provided THEN the system **SHALL** initiate a crawling process using Crawlee.
2. WHEN a maximum page limit is set THEN the system **SHALL** stop crawling after reaching that limit.
3. WHEN a crawl depth is specified THEN the system **SHALL** limit crawling to the specified number of link levels.
4. WHEN same-domain-only option is enabled THEN the system **SHALL** only follow links within the same domain.
5. WHEN crawling completes THEN the system **SHALL** return a structured result containing all scraped pages.
6. WHEN individual page scraping fails during crawl THEN the system **SHALL** log the error and continue with remaining pages.
7. WHEN rate limiting is configured THEN the system **SHALL** respect the specified delays between requests.
8. WHEN robots.txt is present THEN the system **SHALL** check and respect crawl directives.
9. WHEN the crawl encounters circular links THEN the system **SHALL** detect and avoid infinite loops.
10. WHEN crawl results are aggregated THEN the system **SHALL** provide summary statistics including total pages and errors.

### Requirement 3: Sitemap Processing

**User Story:** As a `Data Engineer`, I want to process XML/HTML sitemaps so that I can efficiently discover and scrape all pages on a site.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a sitemap URL is provided THEN the system **SHALL** fetch and parse the sitemap XML.
2. WHEN the sitemap contains nested sitemaps THEN the system **SHALL** recursively process all referenced sitemaps.
3. WHEN sitemap entries include lastmod dates THEN the system **SHALL** extract and preserve modification timestamps.
4. WHEN sitemap entries include changefreq THEN the system **SHALL** extract and preserve change frequency information.
5. WHEN sitemap parsing fails THEN the system **SHALL** attempt to parse as HTML sitemap as fallback.
6. WHEN URLs are extracted from sitemap THEN the system **SHALL** validate each URL format.
7. WHEN sitemap contains invalid URLs THEN the system **SHALL** filter them out and log warnings.
8. WHEN processing completes THEN the system **SHALL** return structured sitemap data with all valid URLs.
9. WHEN sitemap is compressed (gzip) THEN the system **SHALL** automatically decompress and parse.
10. WHEN sitemap exceeds size limits THEN the system **SHALL** handle streaming parsing to manage memory usage.

### Requirement 4: Batch URL Processing

**User Story:** As a `Data Scientist`, I want to scrape multiple URLs concurrently so that I can efficiently process large datasets.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an array of URLs is provided THEN the system **SHALL** initiate concurrent scraping using configured concurrency limits.
2. WHEN concurrency limit is set THEN the system **SHALL** process URLs in batches without exceeding the limit.
3. WHEN individual URL scraping fails THEN the system **SHALL** continue processing remaining URLs and track failures.
4. WHEN timeout is configured THEN the system **SHALL** apply the timeout to each individual request.
5. WHEN retry count is specified THEN the system **SHALL** retry failed requests up to the specified limit.
6. WHEN batch processing completes THEN the system **SHALL** return results for successful scrapes and list of failures.
7. WHEN batch contains duplicate URLs THEN the system **SHALL** deduplicate before processing.
8. WHEN batch processing is interrupted THEN the system **SHALL** provide partial results for completed URLs.
9. WHEN memory limits are approached THEN the system **SHALL** implement backpressure to prevent memory exhaustion.
10. WHEN batch results are aggregated THEN the system **SHALL** provide comprehensive statistics and error summaries.

### Requirement 5: RAG Data Embedding

**User Story:** As a `AI Engineer`, I want to embed scraped data into the RAG system so that it can be used for semantic search and generation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scraped data is provided THEN the system **SHALL** chunk the content using the configured chunking strategy.
2. WHEN content is chunked THEN the system **SHALL** create Document objects with appropriate metadata.
3. WHEN documents are prepared THEN the system **SHALL** index them using the configured vector store indexer.
4. WHEN indexing completes successfully THEN the system **SHALL** return success confirmation with document count.
5. WHEN indexing fails THEN the system **SHALL** provide detailed error information and partial success status.
6. WHEN source IDs are provided THEN the system **SHALL** use them for document identification and deduplication.
7. WHEN metadata is included THEN the system **SHALL** preserve it in the indexed documents.
8. WHEN embedding process is monitored THEN the system **SHALL** provide progress updates for large datasets.
9. WHEN duplicate content is detected THEN the system **SHALL** handle updates vs. new insertions appropriately.
10. WHEN RAG flow ID is specified THEN the system **SHALL** ensure data is indexed for the correct flow context.

### Requirement 6: Content Extraction and Formatting
