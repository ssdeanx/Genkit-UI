# A2A Reliability & Resiliency Spike

## Summary

**Spike Objective:** Identify failure modes, retry strategies, and monitoring approaches for the project's Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication channel (MCP/A2A bridge + @a2a-js/sdk) and propose a small prototype to harden reliability.

**Why This Matters:** The orchestrator delegates tasks to multiple agents (planning, research, coder, content-editor) via A2A. Unreliable messaging, partial failures, or unhandled timeouts will yield incomplete results and poor UX. This spike determines safe defaults for retries, timeouts, backoff, and state reconciliation.

**Timebox:** 4 days

**Decision Deadline:** 4 days from start to avoid blocking agent orchestration development.

## Research Question(s)

**Primary Question:** What are the best-practice retry, timeout, and state-reconciliation strategies to make A2A communications reliable while avoiding duplicate work or livelock?

**Secondary Questions:**

- How should the orchestrator detect and recover from agent crashes, long-running tasks, or partial streaming failures?
- What monitoring/observability signals should be emitted (task start/finish/status/progress/errors) and where should they be collected?
- Which backoff algorithm and maximum retry limits balance timeliness and cost?
- How should idempotency and message deduplication be implemented across agents?

## Investigation Plan

### Research Tasks

- [ ] Inventory current A2A usage in `src/mcp/` and `src/agents/orchestrator-agent/` (task-delegator, a2a-communication, streaming-handler).
- [ ] Review `@a2a-js/sdk` docs for streaming, retry, and connection management features.
- [ ] Identify existing error handling in `src/agents/*` (look for try/catch, timeouts, status updates).
- [ ] Prototype a small resilience wrapper that adds:
  - request timeouts and per-task deadlines
  - exponential backoff with jitter for retries
  - idempotency keys and deduplication in the bridge
  - health-check/ping endpoints and a simple agent status registry
- [ ] Run local experiments using `src/cli.ts` to simulate agent slowdowns, crashes, and message loss.
- [ ] Document recommended defaults and add unit tests / integration test POC.

### Success Criteria

This spike is complete when:

- [ ] A clear set of retry/timeouts/backoff defaults are documented (e.g., 5s connect timeout, 30s task deadline, exponential backoff up to 5 retries with jitter).
- [ ] A prototype wrapper for `mcpClient` demonstrates retries and idempotency in local tests.
- [ ] A short test script or vitest integration demonstrates recovery from simulated agent failure.
- [ ] Recommendations are written for production (monitoring, alerts, metrics to collect).

## Technical Context

**Related Components:**

- [mcpClient.ts](../../src/mcp/mcpClient.ts)
- [mcpServer.ts](../../src/mcp/mcpServer.ts)
- [task-delegator.ts](../../src/agents/orchestrator-agent/task-delegator.ts)
- [a2a-communication.ts](../../src/agents/orchestrator-agent/a2a-communication.ts)
- [streaming-handler.ts](../../src/agents/orchestrator-agent/streaming-handler.ts)
- [cli.ts](../../src/cli.ts) (for local testing)

**Dependencies:**

- `@a2a-js/sdk`
- Genkit A2A patterns and existing `ai` flows in `src/agents/*/genkit.ts`

**Constraints:**

- Local development must remain lightweightâ€”prototype should not require cloud infra.
- Avoid aggressive retry behavior that may duplicate expensive model calls.

## Research Findings

### Investigation Results

[Document research findings, links to docs, and decision notes here during the spike.]

### Prototype/Testing Notes

[Log experiments from local runs here.]

### External Resources

- `@a2a-js/sdk` documentation (review for streaming and error handling)
- Genkit A2A/agent docs in `.github/` and `plans/`

## Decision

### Recommendation

[Write recommendation after completing research and experiments.]

### Rationale

[Explain reasoning behind chosen defaults and design decisions.]

### Implementation Notes

[Outline changes to `task-delegator`, `mcpClient`, and `mcpServer`â€”include API/design notes for idempotency keys and status tracking.]

### Follow-up Actions

- [ ] Implement resilience wrapper in `src/mcp/` and add unit tests
- [ ] Add simple agent status dashboard (console or local UI)
- [ ] Add monitoring metrics and alerts in production guidance
