# AI Memory / Context Management

- Context management in AI systems involves handling and utilizing the information that an AI model has access to during interactions. Effective context management ensures that the AI can maintain coherent and relevant conversations, remember important details, and provide accurate responses.
- This is a notebook for detailed notes on AI memory and context management strategies.
- AI Agents will manage this memory and context to provide better responses.
- The notebook will include strategies, techniques, and best practices for managing context in AI systems.
- Always log changes with date, time, description, agent. (e.g., 2025-09-25, 10:00 AM, Added section on short-term memory, team)
  - Use version control to track changes and updates to the notebook.
  - This notebook will be a living document, updated as new insights and techniques are discovered.
  - Goal is to be able to reference this notebook for improving AI memory and context management in future work in this project.
